// Hydra Audio — GPL-3.0
// DaemonService — starts the Hydra audio engine IN-PROCESS.
//
// Hydra used to ship the engine as a separate `hydrad` LaunchAgent process; the
// app launched it and talked to it over a loopback WebSocket. The engine now
// runs inside Hydra.app itself (see HydraDaemon/DaemonRuntime), so there is no
// second process to register, launch, or kill. This type keeps the small surface
// the UI already calls (`enable()`, `isEnabled`) and now just boots the in-process
// runtime; the UI is still a WebSocket client of ws://127.0.0.1:59731, which now
// loops back within the same process.
