// Language modes here mirror the shipping build only where it's safe to do so
// under SwiftPM. The Xcode project (Scripts/generate_xcodeproj.rb) builds EVERY
// target in full Swift 6 mode with `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete` and
// per-target actor isolation — that's the real gate (and what CI runs).
//
// Under SwiftPM we enable Swift 6 mode for HydraCore + its tests (so `swift test`
// matches CI's strict-concurrency checking of the pure code), and keep the app /
// daemon / plugin-host at v5 here: SwiftPM has no equivalent of the project's
// `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`, so flipping them to v6 under
// SwiftPM alone would diverge from the Xcode build. They stay strictly checked in
// Xcode/CI; `swift test` doesn't build them anyway.
