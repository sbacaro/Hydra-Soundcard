# Hydra Audio — GPL-3.0
# DEV helper: build + install all 8 Hydra Audio Bridge drivers, then restart
# coreaudiod so they appear in Audio MIDI Setup. For iterating locally during
# development. The SHIPPING installer builds and installs these for end users —
# see Packaging/build_pkg.sh (the .pkg lays down every bridge + the engine hub).
#
# Usage:
#   bash Scripts/bridges_install.sh          # build + install all 8
#   bash Scripts/bridges_install.sh 2A 4     # only specific bridges
#
# Requires: the Xcode project has been generated (xcodegen generate, or
# ruby Scripts/generate_xcodeproj.rb) AFTER the bridge targets were added.
